## Work Experience
- (Febrary 2025 - August 2025) Teaching assitanship, Analysis II.
- (August 2024 - January 2025) Teaching assitanship, Partial Differential Equations I.
- (September 2021 - Febrary 2022) Research assistantship, Partial Differential Equations.
  - I studied the global solution of a Navier-Stokes-type chemotaxis system with two competitive Lotka-Volterra species; this work formed the basis of my bachelor's thesis.
