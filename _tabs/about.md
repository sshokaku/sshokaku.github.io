Hi there! 👋 I'm **Genner Pineda**, an applied mathematician driven by curiosity and a love for discovery. My journey revolves around exploring the elegance of **Partial Differential Equations**, diving into the intricate world of **non-local operators** and **variational methods**.  

🔭 I find inspiration at the intersection of **physics**, **probability**, **finance**, and **coding**—fields where abstract ideas meet real-world challenges.  

When I’m not unraveling equations, I enjoy exploring new tools, learning, and sharing insights about the beauty of mathematics and its applications.

Below is a brief overview of my CV. For more details, please refer to the full version of my [CV](/assets/documents/CV.pdf).

## **Education**

- **(2025-2029) PhD Mathematics, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).**
  - I work on the development of variational methods for fractional partial differential equations and the implementation of the finite element method (FEM) in this context.

- **(2023-2024) Master's Degree in Science - Mathematics, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM).**  
  - Graduated with honors.  
  - General exams (Qualifying exams): Partial Differential Equations, Functional Analysis, and Numerical Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equations.  
  - Final project: [Formulación variacional para problemas de difusión anómala unidimensionales](/assets/documents/tesina.pdf).

- **(2017-2022) Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics, Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL).**   
  - Research assistantship in Partial Differential Equations.  
  - Final project: [Sobre la existencia, unicidad, regularidad, acotamiento y estabilidad de un sistema de quimiotaxis-Navier-Stokes de dos especies con cinéticas competitivas](/assets/documents/Trabajo_de_Grado_Genner__Copy_.pdf).
